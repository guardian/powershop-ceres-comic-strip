          <img class="c-panels__image" src="images/image-01.png" alt="On the site of a former bluestone quarry and municipal tip, CERES started life as a community garden and a compost heap. From those humble beginnings their education program was born, with school kids bussed in to learn about sustainability.">
        </div>
        <div class="c-panels__item">
          <img class="c-panels__image" src="images/image-02.png" alt="Year by year CERES grew. They built market gardens, a nursery, cafe, organic market, food delivery service and green technology demonstrations. Visitors came for tours, training and education (from early childhood to tertiary). “Now more than 400,000 visits per year!”">

        <div class="c-panels__item">
          <img class="c-panels__image" src="images/image-03.png" alt="Renewable energy is central to the CERES mission. From day one team members recognised the impact of climate change on the environment and the perils of relying on fossil fuels. Clean, renewable energy was top of mind.">

        <div class="c-panels__item">
          <img class="c-panels__image" src="images/image-04.png" alt="A hybrid energy system linked CERES to the grid with renewable energy solutions generating power for the park. A solar workshop was built so Melbournites could see solar panels up close for the first time, and learn how they worked.">
        </div>
        <div class="c-panels__item">
          <img class="c-panels__image" src="images/image-05.png" alt="An old timber house was moved to the park and became a demonstration low-energy house. All over the site old buildings were installed and re-purposed, and new venues were custom built using environmentally sustainable design – as inspiration for visitors.">
        </div>
        <div class="c-panels__item">
          <img class="c-panels__image" src="images/image-06.png" alt="“Wake up call!” Early on, CERES was generating up to 25% of its own electricity needs. But as the park grew and technology evolved, that percentage dropped. It wasn’t enough to talk about being environmental pioneers. They had to walk the walk.">
        </div>
        <div class="c-panels__item">
          <img class="c-panels__image" src="images/image-07.png" alt="So in early 2017 CERES established two key goals as part of its first ever Environmental Management Plan: 40% renewable energy by 2025; zero emissions by 2025. It’s a group effort! CERES staff were encouraged to get engaged with energy saving - to come forward with ideas to reduce electricity use in their area. “Do we need the aircon on today?” “Last one out, turn the printer off at the wall.”">
        </div>
        <div class="c-panels__item">
          <img class="c-panels__image" src="images/image-08.png" alt="CERES partners with all levels of government, corporates, industry and volunteers – it’s crucial to the Plan. Check out their solar electric vehicle charge station as a perfect example of partnership in motion. “Assisted by federal government funding.” “Industry partners: Delta Energy Systems, Q Cells Solar Panels chargepoint.” “Part of the state government electrical vehicle trial.” “Corporate volunteers helped erect the pre-fab structure.” “State government land.”">
        </div>
        <div class="c-panels__item">
          <img class="c-panels__image" src="images/image-09.png" alt="Shopping around for an electricity provider, CERES gravitated towards Powershop, Australia’s greenest power company (Greenpeace 2014 & 2015). Thanks to the CERES-Powershop partnership, each time someone switches to Powershop, CERES receives a financial contribution to help install more solar panels.">
        </div>
        <div class="c-panels__item">
          <img class="c-panels__image" src="images/image-10.png" alt="In 2016 when Powershop started its Your Community Energy initiative, CERES was one of the community renewable energy projects to receive a $10,000 grant. How was it funded? Powershop customers chose to pay a little bit extra (4c in fact) on top of their electricity rates!">
        </div>
        <div class="c-panels__item">
          <img class="c-panels__image" src="images/image-11.png" alt="CERES used their $10,000 grant to complete a 15KW rooftop solar system installation. “Saves them $2,000 each year.” “Reduces their yearly emissions by almost 16 tonnes of CO2.” “That’s one giant step toward zero emissions.”">
        </div>
        <div class="c-panels__item">
          <img class="c-panels__image" src="images/image-12.png" alt="Thanks to the extraordinary generosity of powershop customers! “$20,000 – Total amount Powershop aimed to raise with Your Community Energy by the end of 2016.” “$100,000 – Total amount Powershop actually raised with Your Community Energy by Feb 2017!” “$300,000 – Total amount Powershop has raised with Your Community Energy as at November 2017 (and customers just keep on giving).” Your Community Energy showed what CERES already knew. People are behind renewable energy and individuals can make a huge difference.">
